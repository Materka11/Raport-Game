# Raport-Game
The **Raport-Game** project is a JavaScript-based game created to test skills in JavaScript and CSS. The concept revolves around determining whether suspects in the game are guilty or not, requiring the player to use various tools to monitor suspicious behavior.

The game ends either in victory (after three correct assessments) or failure (after two incorrect ones). While it takes inspiration from the game Scrutinized, most of the functionality and mechanics are designed by the developer. It is optimized for desktop use, leveraging CSS features like grid and flexbox for layout.
