# Raport-Game
A game of choosing whether a suspect is guilty or not

I started doing this game on 09/19/2020 to check my skills in pure JavaScript. Technologies used in this game are pure JavaScript and CSS3. CSS uses tools such as grid and flexbox

The game is about keeping an eye on suspicious people. Various tools are available there. The game ends with a failure after two unsuccessful ones and a victory after three successful ones. General idea taken from game called Scrutinized but most of the functions and are invented by myself

Version intended for desktop computers only
